Reverse shell generator v1.5 is a minimalist bash program that makes the process of generating reverse shells during CTFs
or real world pentesting much quicker and easier. Simply specify the IP/interface and listening port you wish to recieve 
the reverse shell on and then select which shell type you wish to generate. You can even generate all shells (option a) for prolonged 
enumeration. The program will then prompt you if you wish to open the specified listening port automatically. 

Future updates:
Better formatting for the a) option 
Colour-coding for the a) option
Generate file-based reverse shells such as php
